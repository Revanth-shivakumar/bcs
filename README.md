# Cow Body Condition Score Prediction Using Deep Learning (ResNet-10)

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the body condition score (BCS) of cows using a deep learning model based on a ResNet-10 architecture. The BCS is a visual assessment of the cow's body fat and muscle mass, which is important for monitoring animal health, reproductive performance, and overall welfare. By leveraging ResNet-10, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), the model aims to automate and improve the accuracy of BCS prediction from images of cows.

## Features

- **Image-based BCS Prediction**: Predicts the body condition score of cows from images.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Implements a ResNet-10 architecture for feature extraction and classification.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles image preprocessing including resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
- **Model Training**: Provides a framework for training the deep learning model on labeled datasets of cow images with BCS annotations.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
